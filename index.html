<h4>NOTES STAGE 0 AND STAGE 1:</h4>
<h2>Basic of Web and HTML</h2>
What's coding? Coding is simply a way to communicate with the computers. Computer doesn't have language 
like human do, and it's stupid.
Somehow, we need to interpret our language so that computer can understand us. 
That's what coding is actually is.<br><br>
HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is the type of file that is commonly
used in a webpage. A webpage can also contain plain-text, images, videos, 
links, but HTML is the brain of a webpage. <br><br>
<b>How a web actually works</b><br>
When you surf with <em>browser</em> on your computer, the computer sends data to <em>internet</em> request
using the protocol <em>http</em> to the <em>server</em>. The server then finds
the appropriate answer and return it again to our computer. Server itself is actually a computer, but 
it's super strong and is not used like the regular computer.<br><br>
<b>HTML</b><br>
HTML consists of many mark-up language, following the text. The mark-up language doesn't appear on the webpage, 
but it gives the special effect to the text that it applies to. A mark-up languages has a
structure like: &lt;name>text&lt;/name>. Some mark-up language need to have open tag and closing tag, 
but some doesn't. Example of a mark-up language:<br>
<b>1. Bold</b><br>
The formula for bold is &lt;b>text&lt;/b> (b means bold). For example: 
If we write &lt;b>text&lt;/b>, the computer will intepret it as:<b>text</b><br>
<b>2.Italic</b><br>
The formula for italic is &lt;em>text&lt;/em> (em means emphasis). For example: 
If we write &lt;em>text&lt;/em>, the computer will intepret it as:<em>text</em><br>
<b>3.Break</b><br>
Br means break. HTML can't understand enter command. Some text will need to have break to give reader
nice space while reading. A long one line text is extremelly exhausting to read.
The tag for br is &lt;br>. This is one of tag that doesn't need closing tag. 
For example: text&ltbr>text will be intepreted as: <br>text<br>text<br>
<b>4. Paragraph</b><br>
Another way to break long line is using &lt;p> symbol (p means paragraph).
This one needs closing tag, while break tag doesn't. But there is quite a difference
between &ltbr> and &ltp>. Break just break the line, while paragraph will create
some sort of bounding box accross the content of it. This box will have attribute
like height and weight. We can classify this into 2: inline tag and block tag.
Bold, italic, break are inline tag, while p, div, form are block tag.
<br>
<b>5.Links</b><br>
The formula to create link is &lt;a attr (attribute)>content&lt;/a> (a means anchor). For example: 
If we write &lt;a href="www.udacity.com">text&lt;/a>, the word "text" will be
a link:<a href="www.udacity.com">text</a><br>
<b>6.Images</b><br>
The formula for images is &lt;img attr alt=""> (img means image). For example: 
If we write &lt;img src="http://goo.gl/Sh9FXJ" alt="html">, computer will display
images based on the link we provide:<img src="http://goo.gl/Sh9FXJ" alt="html" width="50px">
Note that the image will appear inline with the text, and the tag doesn't need 
closing tag (just like &ltbr>). Alt is the text that will appear when the image
couldn't be loaded (maybe wrong links, etc). So alt is not really necessarry,
but it is good to have.

<p>
  While knowing these <em>html tag</em>, we already have basic webpage, in order
  to create an actual website, it needs <em>more</em> than just mark-up languages.
  The structure of actual webpage is:
  <br>&lt!doctype html><br>
  &lthtml><br>
  &lthead><br>
  &lt/head><br>
  &ltbody><br>
  &ltmark-up languages><br>
  &lt/body><br>
  &lt/html><br>
</p>

<p>
  doctype just the indicator of html page, head will contain javascript, css, meta-datas, 
  fonts, etc. Body is where the mark-up languages is.
